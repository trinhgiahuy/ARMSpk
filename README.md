# Compiler comparison on A64FX

## Cloning the repo
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/domke/a64fxCvC
```

## License
BSD-3-Clause

## HowTo use this framework (follow these instructions):
### Installation of dependencies:
- check ./inst/_init.sh for missing dependencies

### Compile each benchmark:
- for llvm12 without polly do `cd inst; for x in `ls *sh`; do sed -i -e 's/flto=full/flto=thin/g' -e 's/-mllvm -polly -mllvm -polly-vectorizer=polly//' $x; done; cd -`
- execute `./inst/*.sh [fujitrad | fujiclang | llvm12 | gnu]` for all files and the desired compiler (except those starting with underscore)
- note: some benchmarks might need external and/or download additional files which are not part of this repo due to license contraints
- note: a newer version of RIKEN's micro kernels can be accessed here: https://github.com/RIKEN-RCCS/fs2020-tapp-kernels/tree/main/tapp-kernels ; please integrate it yourself if needed

### Running each benchmark:
- execute `./run/*/test.sh [fujitrad | fujiclang | llvm12 | gnu]` to search for best number ranks and threads per node
- modify BESTCONF variable in ./conf/*
- execute `./run/*/best.sh [fujitrad | fujiclang | llvm12 | gnu]` for final performance runs
- investigate logs in ./log/<hostname>/[b|t]estrun/<bench>.log
