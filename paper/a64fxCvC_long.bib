ARM and its partners have collaborately grown an HPC ecosystem with software and hardware solutions that provide choice in a unified software ecosystem. Partners have announced important HPC deployments resulting from collaborations around the globe. One of the key enabling technologies for ARM in HPC is the Scalable Vector Extension, an instruction set extension for vector processing. This paper discusses ARM's journey into HPC, the current state of the ARM HPC ecosystem, the approach to HPC node architecture co-design, and details on the Scalable Vector Extension as a future technology representing the reemergence of vectors.},

	abstract = {In the late 1990s, powerful economic forces led to the adoption of commodity desktop processors in high-performance computing. This transformation has been so effective that the June 2013 TOP500 list is still dominated by x86.In 2013, the largest commodity market in computing is not PCs or servers, but mobile computing, comprising smart-phones and tablets, most of which are built with ARM-based SoCs. This leads to the suggestion that once mobile SoCs deliver sufficient performance, mobile SoCs can help reduce the cost of HPC.This paper addresses this question in detail. We analyze the trend in mobile SoC performance, comparing it with the similar trend in the 1990s. We also present our experience evaluating performance and efficiency of mobile SoCs, deploying a cluster and evaluating the network and scalability of production applications. In summary, we give a first answer as to whether mobile SoCs are ready for HPC.},

	abstract = {We have been carrying out the FLAGSHIP 2020 Project to develop the Japanese next-generation flagship supercomputer, the Post-K, recently named "Fugaku". We have designed an original manycore processor based on Armv8 instruction sets with the Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), an A64FX processor, as well as a system including interconnect and a storage subsystem with the industry partner, Fujitsu. The "co-design" of the system and applications is a key to making it power efficient and high performance. We determined many architectural parameters by reflecting an analysis of a set of target applications provided by applications teams. In this paper, we present the pragmatic practice of our co-design effort for "Fugaku". As a result, the system has been proven to be a very power-efficient system, and it is confirmed that the performance of some target applications using the whole system is more than 100 times the performance of the K computer.},
