\section{Methodology}
% goal: 1.5 page
% no changes to any code (unless fixing bug)
% 2 similar architecture, executed lots of bench for flops/memory/power
% normalize results on #cores (avoid bad numa settings); change freq to 1.3Ghz; etc -> to reduce obvious differences betw KNL/KNM
% xhost, intel, same compile
% run parameter sweep
%    #runs per app -> min/max/avg???
% strong scaling vs weak scaling
% tools/profileer/etc used ("exclusive" to intel SW stack + open-source)
% subsection on oddities of our config:
%    compiler/OS/kernel (w/ meltdown patch)
%    stupid mcdram behavior -> warm up ...
%    intel_pstate=disable for freq
%    fixed uncore freq.
