We compared two architectural similar processors that have different double-precision
silicon budget. By studying a large number of HPC proxy application, we found no significant 
performance difference between these two processors, despite one having more double-precision
compute than the other. Our study points toward a growing need to re-iterate and re-think
architecture design decisions in high-performance computing, especially with respect
to precision. 
Do we really need the amount of double-precision compute that modern processors offer?
Our results on the Intel Xeon Phi twins points towards a 'No', and we hope that this
work inspires other researchers to also challenge the floating-point to silicon distribution
for the available and future general-purpose processors, graphical processors, or
accelerators in HPC systems.
