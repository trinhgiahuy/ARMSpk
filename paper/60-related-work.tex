%\struc{alternative mini-apps, by prace, etc}
Apart from RIKEN's mini-apps and the ECP proxy-apps, which we use for our study, there are numerous benchmark suites
based on proxy application from other HPC centers and institutes available
~\cite{prace_unified_2016,noauthor_mantevo_nodate,nersc_characterization_nodate,llnl_llnl_nodate,llnl_coral_nodate,spec_spec_nodate}.
Overall these lists show a partial overlap, either directly (i.e. same benchmark) or indirectly (same
scientific domain), between all these suites, which, for example, were used to analyze message passing characteristic~\cite{klenk_overview_2017} or to assess how predictable full application performance is
based on proxy-app measurements~\cite{barrett_assessing_2015}.
Hence, our systematic approach and published framework \textbf{\url{https://github.com/jdomke/PAstudy}} can be
transferred to these alternative benchmarks for complementary studies, and our included raw data
can be investigated further w.r.t metrics which were outside the scope of our study.
