\section{Discussion and Implications}
% goal: 1 page

% - themes: time-to-solution is most important metric
% - instructions doesn't matter too much because most are memory-bound
% - apps have different requirements
% - people need to dive deeper into their workloads
% - suggestion: decouple notion of hpc apps need high FP64 and which architecture to choose => see if NASA has papers on their design choices?!
% - breakdown of node-hours on science fields across many hpc centers

% - option: suggest to ditch fp32 and emulate fp32 ops in fp64 units
% - mixed precision can't work (requ. hand tuning in each app) -> not practical
% - compute bound codes -> what if no FP64 anymore in new chips -> what will they do?
% - memory bound: doesn't matter if fp64 is gone
% lay out options for comp.-bound guys:
% a) library
% b) mixed precision
% c) emulated by 2 fp32
% d) hope for cpu support for faster emulation
% e) accept the perf hit :-(
